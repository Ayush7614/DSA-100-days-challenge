# Asymptotic Analysis

We use three Notation to dispaly space and time complexity
- Big O
- thetha ɵ
- Omega Ω 

## Big O Notation:

It describes the upper bound of an algorithm runtime.
- Ignore the lower order terms
- Ignore the leading coefficient

Whenever we found the worst case it cover all cases with big O

## Theta ɵ Notation

It describe the exact bound of an algorithm runtime

## Omega  Ω  Notation

It describes the lower bound of an algorithm.

 # Space Complexity
 
 Order of growth of memory RAM space in term of input size.
 
 ## Auxiliary Space
 Order of growth of extra space or temporary space in terms of input size.
